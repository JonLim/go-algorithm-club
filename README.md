# Welcome to the Go Algorithm Club!

Inspired by the [Swift Algorithm Club](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club), the aim is to showcase implementations of popular algorithms and data structures in [Go](https://golang.org/), with detailed explanations of how they work.

Personally speaking, the goal of this project is to **improve my understanding of how algorithms work**, primarily using Go for implementation, as that is what I work with, and choose to work with, in my daily programming work.

Overall, similarly to the Swift Algorithm Club, the goal is to **explain how algorithms work**, with a focus on clarity and readability of the code, not for a reusable library for your own projects. Much of the explanations will use the Swift Algorithm Club's readmes as a starting point, when possible.

Code is written with **Go 1.12.5**.

## Algorithms (WIP!)

### Searching

- [Linear Search](Linear-Search/). Find an element in an array.
- [Binary Search](Binary-Search/). Quickly find elements in a sorted array.
- [Count Occurrences](Count-Occurrences/). Count how often a value appears in an array.
- [Select Minimum / Maximum](Select-Minimum-Maximum/). Find the minimum/maximum value in an array.
