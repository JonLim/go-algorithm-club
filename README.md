# Welcome to the Go Algorithm Club!

Inspired by the [Swift Algorithm Club](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club), the aim is to showcase implementations of popular algorithms and data structures in [Go](https://golang.org/), with detailed explanations of how they work.

Personally speaking, the goal of this project is to **improve my understanding of how algorithms work**, primarily using Go for implementation, as that is what I work with, and choose to work with, in my daily programming work.

Overall, similarly to the Swift Algorithm Club, the goal is to **explain how algorithms work**, with a focus on clarity and readability of the code, not for a reusable library for your own projects. Much of the explanations will use the Swift Algorithm Club's readmes as a starting point, when possible.

Code is written with **Go 1.12.9**.

## Algorithms (WIP!)

### Searching

- [Linear Search](Algorithms/Searching/Linear-Search/). Find an element in an array.
- [Binary Search](Algorithms/Searching/Binary-Search/). Quickly find elements in a sorted array.
- [Count Occurrences](Algorithms/Searching/Count-Occurrences/). Count how often a value appears in an array.
- [Select Minimum / Maximum](Algorithms/Searching/Select-Minimum-Maximum/). Find the minimum/maximum value in an array.
- [k-th Largest Element](Algorithms/Searching/Kth-Largest-Element/). Find the k-th largest element in an array, such as the median.

### Sorting

#### Basic Sorts

- [Insertion Sort](Algorithms/Sorting/Insertion-Sort/). Sort values by inserting to correct position.
- [Selection Sort](Algorithms/Sorting/Selection-Sort/). Sort by comparing values.
- [Shell Sort](Algorithms/Sorting/Shell-Sort). Improvement of insertion sort, using smaller subsets.

#### Fast Sorts

- [Quicksort](Algorithms/Sorting/Quicksort/).
